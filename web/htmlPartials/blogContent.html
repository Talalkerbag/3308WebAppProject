<h3>Data Model</h3>
<p>
    The Data Model has four tables. A User, Problem, Solution and User Role tables. Each user has a "Role"; either Admin, Normal User or Guest. Each User can create a problem
    and provide a solution for any other users to see or could wait for another user to solve the problem for them. The Solution Table connects both the User and Problem Table.

<h3>Homework 1: Web Proposal</h3>
<p>
    In this homework, I came up with a business idea that could be helpful in the todays technological world and 
    fulfills the requirements for the class.

<h3>Homework 2: Database</h3>

<h3>Homework 3: JSP Home Page</h3>
<p>
    In this Homework, I learned how to use ajax calls to reference and add the content from two other html pages 
    into index.html; the blog and home content pages. I learned how to have a CSS page separately and reference it to my index.html using href. In my style css page
    I changed background color for the body and nav bar. I also changed the font family for the body.

<h3>Homework 4: Data Display</h3>
<p>
    Displaying the data for the user table was easy, all I had to do was change the database credentials and it worked. Displaying the data for the other table and associated
    table was difficult. I had to study the StringData.java, StringDataList.java, WebUserView.java and listUsersAPI.jsp files to understand how it was able to access the 
    database and display the data in an html file. Once I understood how I duplicated these files with different given names and data to be able to access and display the other
    two tables in the database.

<h3>Homework 5: Log on</h3>
<p>
    For this homework I created a logoncontent.html file to for the user to submite their account information to logon.
    upon submitting, the information will go to the logon.js which will an ajax call to the logonAPI.jsp which will 
    check the database. If the credentials are correct it will proceed and show some information on the same page. Clicking
    profile while logged in will show the user information. I have created a session that hold the user information if they are
    logged on and upon logging out the session will clear and you will no longer be able to view the information. This homework 
    was a little challenging but fun. I learned a lot!

<h3>Homework 6: Insert</h3>
<p>
    For this homework I had to learn the code that made the rolelist appear and the code in DbMods to insert into the database in order to 
    implement it on my user, problem and solution list. Studying the code was the hard part, implementing was a puzzle. I created a userCRUD,
    solutionCRUD, problemCRUD, and insertUser, insertProblem and insertSolution APIS and modified the DbMods to have functions to insert each one of 
    them into the database. in solutionCRUD i had to make two foreign key lists, one for the web user and another for the problem.

<h3>Homework 7: Delete</h3>
<p>
    This Homework was pretty straight forward, did not take much time to learn how to delete a user and then implement
    the same mechanics to delete from my associate table and other table. I added three delete API for User, Problem and 
    Solution and three delete functions in dbMods that connected to the database and deleted an user, problem or solution.

<h3>Homework 8: Update</h3>
<p>
    Doing the user update was easy because of the code given by the professor, only three more values to be updated to the project.
    However doing the other and associate update took few hours. Figuring out what page of code did what and tracing back and forward
    again to understand what is going on was difficult.
    The pages that were associated with user update were the htmlpartials, userCRUD, getUserById, updateUser (in search).
    The pages that were associated with problem (other) update were the htmlpartials, problemCRUD, getProblemById, updateProblem (in search).
    The pages that were associated with solution (associate) update were the htmlpartials, solutionCRUD, getSolutionById, updateSolution (in search).

    Things I learned doing this lab is how to connect to the database and use the URL tempering to change the values or make a User interface to do it
