        In the information technology infrastructure library there is a volume that 
        speaks very highly of the importance of having a known Error Database in any IT department. One of 
        the main and most important reason for having a KEDB implemented into your business is its downtime 
        reduction capability; if an incident is already reported, a user does not have to wait long for a 
        response from the help desk because a workaround likely already exists.

        Furthermore, when a workaround 
        already exists, visiting users will not have to troubleshoot on their own. When user is troubleshooting
        without the help of IT, the users productive work time decreases significantly. This also helps the user
        use their own skills for their own work!
